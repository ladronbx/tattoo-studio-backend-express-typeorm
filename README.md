# üöÄ Description
## Appointment and User Management Project for Tattoo Studio

This project focuses on developing an API that enables clients of a tattoo studio to schedule appointments through a mobile application. It's important to note that while the interface is pending, the backend system is designed to manage appointment creation and user administration. The following outlines the key aspects of the project:

## User Management
- **User Registration**: Allows new clients to register on the platform through a public endpoint, validating the provided information.
- **User Login**: Facilitates existing users to log in with verified credentials to obtain an authentication token.
- **User Profile**: Permits authenticated users to access their personal information and profile details.
- **User Listing**: Enables superusers to access information about all registered users.
- **Profile Update**: Provides users with the ability to update their personal information.

## Appointment Management
- **Appointment Creation**: Allows authenticated clients to schedule new appointments, verifying the availability of date, time, and the artist.
- **Artist Calendar View**: Permits authenticated artists to view their scheduled appointments.
- **Appointment Deletion**: Enables users to cancel an existing appointment using a unique identifier.
- **All Appointments View**: Allows superusers to access all appointments for display in a calendar format.
- **Detailed Appointment View**: Provides a comprehensive view of all appointments, including additional information.
- **User's Appointments View**: Allows clients to view all their scheduled appointments.

The system has been designed with a clearly defined endpoint structure to carry out user and appointment management operations. While it currently lacks a graphical interface, the focus on the backend ensures a robust foundation for future implementations of a visual interface. The diagram and the list of endpoints provide a detailed overview of the functionalities and operations available in the system.

# üéØ Objective

The main objective of the "Backend Tattoo & Piercing Studio" project is to provide a robust and complete backend system for managing appointments in a tattoo studio. This system aims to facilitate appointment scheduling for clients and agenda management for tattoo artists. The specific goals of the project include:

- **Developing a Robust API**: Creating a scalable and secure API that allows users (clients and tattoo artists) to interact with the appointment management system.
- **User Management**: Providing complete user management functionalities, including registration, login, profile management, and personal data updates.
- **Appointment Management**: Allowing clients to schedule, modify, and cancel appointments, and enabling tattoo artists to view their appointment schedules.
- **Modular and Scalable Design**: Building a modular and scalable structure that facilitates the future implementation of a visual interface and the expansion of new functionalities.
- **Security and Efficiency**: Ensuring data security and guaranteeing an efficient system for managing appointments and users.

###### The project aims to achieve these objectives by providing an efficient and functional backend that serves as a foundation for future iterations and improvements, with the possibility of integrating a user-friendly interface for clients and tattoo artists.
